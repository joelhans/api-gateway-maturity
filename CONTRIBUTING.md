# Contribute to the API Gateway Maturity Matrix

Thanks for your interest in making this maturity model—err... *matrix*—better.
While this project started as a KubeCon talk (complete with
[slides](/kubecon-eu-2025-talk), it was never designed to live and go quiet all
on the same day—the Matrix gets better with more thoughts and expertise from
both consumers and builders of API gateways.

Let's make this more comprehensive and actionable together!

## Have a question?

If you're not sure about any part of the Matrix as it stands, or simply want to
start a discussion, feel free to create an [issue](/issues/new).

## Ways to actively contribute

Below is a list of potential—but not exhaustive—list of ways you could
contribute to make the Matrix better.

For now, most of these don't have a distinct "home" in the Matrix, so feel free
to create either pull requests or issues with your proposed update and we can
work together to find the right place.

### Add a real-world illustration

In the original KubeCon talk, I included illustrations from a made-up company at
different points in their API gateway maturity to show how others might do this
self-assessment and what their resulting maturity might look like.

What if these illustrations were based on real API gateway implementations from
real companies?

Contribute a case study from your team or company:

- What does your API gateway maturity look like? 
- What's your "radar" shaped like?
- What are you looking to build next?

The Matrix gets richer with more real-world data!

### Suggest new capabilities 

Think the 5 capability threads aren't enough? Or maybe you've implemented a
specific feature and think it belongs in a certain thread+level?

Create a PR with your proposed changes. If you're not quite ready to get
specific, create an issue and we'll talk it through before shipping your ideas.

### Test and improve the self-assessment

Take the maturity model for a spin. Was it useful? Confusing? Open an issue with
feedback or ideas to improve the UX.

### Find a path toward governance and acceptance

Other maturity models are now official parts of the CNCF landscape—perhaps we
could find a way to do the same here... or at least come up with a
community-supported, vendor-neutral way to manage its growth.

### Just say hi

You don't need some grand proposal—even "this helped me" is a wonderful signal
and place to start up more conversations.
