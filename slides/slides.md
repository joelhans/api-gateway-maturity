# The API Gateway Maturity Matrix

## *Where Do You Rank?*

<!--
About me: I'm Joel, and I do all things DevRel at ngrok, the universal gateway
company. I love stories, so let me start with a short one loosely based on
ngrok itself.

It starts with just a simple Python app. It's a one-page marketing site and the
rest of the backend.

Then at some point you need to slap NGINX on it. You need that reverse proxy,
and NGINX is free and trusted.

Then you decide, wait, let's go Kubernetes. Slap that on there. Nice easy
project.

Oh look, some new API services want to sneak in behind your proxy.

And there's Docusaurus, asking for a little space for your new developer
documentation. Slap that on there.

What's that? The dreaded Webflow peeking in?

I'm sure many of you have been in this situation before. To get all this
working, your NGINX proxy is all of a sudden full of complex routing rules and
traffic management policies. All your security in a configuration that's both
strict and verbose.

It's a front door, but it's a fragile one.

# An API gateway is...

The "front door" to all your APIs, handling routing, authentication, security,
and traffic management.

<v-click>

# You need one because‚Ä¶

They are designed specifically to solve the problem of the sprawling ecosystem.
API gateways make expanding your services both simpler and more secure, create a
better experience for your developers, and future-proof your
architecture.

</v-click>

# What is maturity, anyway?

Well, I‚Äôve been asking around.

<v-clicks>

- "The API won't change underneath me."
- "When I get paged because something is broken, it's because of a bug in my
software and not the infrastructure breaking down. `:lolsob:`"

</v-clicks>

# Maturity isn‚Äôt always a good thing.

<v-clicks>

- There's a fine line between *mature* and *legacy*.
- Mature platforms are difficult for you to modify and others to build upon.
- No one understands how a mature platform works anymore, whether that‚Äôs lost institutional
knowledge or it just worked once so leave it alone.
- Hard to steer the ship quickly if you need to do something complex... like
multicloud (yikes).

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## But it _can_ be a conscious effort to get you:

</v-click>

<v-after>
    
- Reliability without surprises.
- Velocity without chaos.
- Scalability without rip-and-replace (again).
- Governance without bureaucracy.

# Why do _I_ care about this?

_A CNCF Story_

<!--

Years ago, I was in a room much like this one in Detroit, Michigan.

I was with 15 or so CTOs and tech leaders from the heaviest hitters of CNCF's
end user community. Can't name names, but they were big ones.

They were there to talk about CNCF's Cloud Native Maturity Model and how they
could apply it to their organizations, particularly from a platform engineering
perspective.

They loved having this kind of roadmap to look forward to, but still
struggled. How were they supposed to apply this to a specific technology?

Fast forward, and I'm in a place where I think about and write about and build
around API gateways all the time. Why not apply this methodology to a specific
technology?

# You should care because‚Ä¶

API gateways are not some set it and forget it tool&mdash;if you don‚Äôt maximize how
you use it, you‚Äôre actively making your life harder. Will your current API
gateway allow you to reach the state of maturity you‚Äôre after?

# Time to introduce you to our maturity levels

<v-clicks>

- **Build**: Pick your poison(s).
- **Operate**: Wrangle chaos with automation.
- **Scale**: Go multi-everything.
- **Improve**: You built an internal developer platform‚Ä¶ deal with it.
- **Adapt**: Advanced, flexible, and future-proofed.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

- Functionality
- Culture
- Benchmarks: What 
- Failure state:

---

# Audience poll: Where do you think you stand?

- üöÄ "Our API gateway is in good shape."
- üèóÔ∏è "We're duct-taping stuff together."
- üî• "NGINX config copy-pasted from Stack Overflow. Send help."

---
transition: slide-up
---

# Build

**Functionality**: Establish a solid foundation for API traffic management.

**Culture**: You treat APIs as products, and thus have clear ownership of how they go into production.

<v-click>

## Benchmarks

- Deployment model: You've decided on vendor-specific vs. self-hosted vs. managed solutions.
- Routing and load balancing: Can you send requests to the right upstream?
- Zero Trust: You support API keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and OpenID connect for AuthN/AuthZ.
- Rate limiting: Can you prevent abuse *and* ensure fair usage?
- Monitoring: You capture request logs, response times, and error rates.

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Failure state**: "Our routing is a labyrinth and we're hardcoding auth. What's a rate limit?"

</v-click>

<!--
Vendor-Specific: AWS API Gateway, Apigee, Azure API Management

Self-Hosted: Kong, Traefik, Envoy

Managed: Cloudflare, Fastly, ngrok

# Operate

**Functionality**: Automate API gateway management and introduce governance mechanisms.

**Culture**: You‚Äôre done with ad-hoc changes and embracing a culture of
automation.

<v-click>

## Benchmarks

- Configuration sync: Use GitOps or IaC tooling to manage configurations.
- Deployment options: Can you support A/B tests or canary releases?
- Versioning: How do you handle deprecation and backwards compatability?
- Dynamic routing: How do you handle moving between different upstream services?
- Observability: You‚Äôre piping API gateway logs to another service, whether
that‚Äôs Prometheus+Grafana or Datadog, to understand API performance.

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Failure state**: ‚ÄúEvery change requires a Slack war, a handful of Linear
tickets, and a few days from everyone‚Äôs life.‚Äù 

</v-click>

---
transition: slide-up
---

# Scale

**Functionality**: Ensure high availability and efficient traffic handling. 

**Culture**: Availability is not just a platform problem, but a shared responsibility. 

<v-click>

## Benchmarks

- Multi-readiness: Do you have *at least* a plan (both technical and human) for
how you‚Äôll go multi-region or multi-cloud?
- Load balancing: Have global DDoS protection and global load balancing, with
your API gateway in multiple PoPs around the world.
- Fine-grained traffic management: Implement per-customer, per-region, or
per-endpoint limits with rate limits.
- Service health: Do you use circuit breakers to prevent cascading
failures from a single service?

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Failure state**: ‚ÄúOur ‚Äòmulti-readiness‚Äô strategy is LGTM‚Äîwhich means it
probably won‚Äôt work in a real failover scenario.‚Äù 

</v-click>

---
transition: slide-up
---

# Improve

**Functionality**: Enable internal teams to ship APIs faster while maintaining
governance. 

**Culture**: You‚Äôre done with ticket-based development with a centralized team
bottlenecking necessary changes and new deployments.

<v-click>

## Benchmarks

- Self-service: Enable teams to define their own API gateway configurations while also controlling some policies equally across all APIs.
- Testing/staging: Provide ephemeral environments for testing *API policies*.
- Zero Trust+: Block access from known malicious IPs, geographies, or anonymous/VPN networks.

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Failure state**: "We built a developer platform... that our developers despise!"

</v-click>

---
transition: slide-left
---

# Adapt

**Functionality**: Support emerging patterns and ensure long-term API strategy alignment. 

**Culture**: You don't overcomplicate your API architecture without a clear ROI. 

<v-click>

## Benchmarks

- Multi-action: You‚Äôre actively supporting cross-cloud or hybrid deployments.
- Governance: You implement identical API governance no matter where your APIs are running or who starts them up.
- Zero Trust++: Are you implementing API posture management or risk-based authentication?
- AI: Sure, throw some AI in there to optimize routing or predict API failures.

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Failure state**: "Our architecture diagram looks like we're finally getting
really close to figuring out who Pepe Silvia is."

</v-click>

# Audience poll: Where do you think you stand now?

- üèÜ "Feeling mature, but not legacy!"
- üöß "We‚Äôve got work to do."
- ü§° "I just realized we don‚Äôt actually have an API gateway."

# What's next?

<v-click>

This model is now an open source repository on GitHub: `joelhans/api-gateway-maturity-model`

I've included details on how anyone can contribute and make the model better:

- Create issues or PRs for quick fixes
- Lend your real-world experience on culture or failure states
- Flesh out the model with more depth and benchmark specificity

</v-click>

<v-click>

You can also read the model in a more human-readable format at `api-gateway-maturity.joelhans.xyz`.

- Fun fact: This is published entirely via an ngrok cloud endpoint!
- README published via simple script that renders the Markdown and creates a
cloud endpoint on the ngrok network, with the HTML as a custom `200` response.
