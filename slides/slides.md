FOR NGROK

Okay, Sam gave me the really good but very terrifying idea of asking the entire
company for feedback on my upcoming KubeCon talk about the idea of API gateway
maturity.

FOR KUBECON

About me: I'm Joel, and I do all things DevRel at ngrok, the universal gateway
company. I love stories, so let me start with a short one loosely based on
ngrok itself.

It starts with just a simple Python app. It's a one-page marketing site and the
rest of the backend.

Then at some point you need to slap NGINX on it. You need that reverse proxy,
and NGINX is free and trusted.

Then you decide, wait, let's go Kubernetes. Slap that on there. Nice easy
project.

Oh look, some new API services want to sneak in behind your proxy.

And there's Docusaurus, asking for a little space for your new developer
documentation. Slap that on there.

What's that? The dreaded Webflow peeking in?

I'm sure many of you have been in this situation before. To get all this
working, your NGINX proxy is all of a sudden full of complex routing rules and
traffic management policies. All your security in a configuration that's both
strict and verbose.

It's a front door, but it's a fragile one.

# An API gateway is...

A "front door" to all your APIs.

A single URL to expose all your APIs to the wild world outside your network.

A way to offload non-functional requirements like AuthN/AuthZ, load balancing,
rate limiting, failover, scaling, and much more from your services.

</v-click>

<v-click>

# You (probably) need one because‚Ä¶

They're designed specifically to solve the problem of the sprawling ecosystem I
just covered.

API gateways make expanding your services both simpler and more secure, create a
better experience for your developers, and future-proof your
architecture.

</v-click>

---
transition: slide-up

# What is maturity, anyway?

To paraphrase the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), maturity is how formal and
actively optimized your processes are, from ad hoc to formally defined.

<v-click>

I‚Äôve been asking around at ngrok, too.

- "The API won't change underneath me."
- "When I get paged because something is broken, it's because of a bug in my
software and not the infrastructure breaking down. `:lolsob:`"

</v-click>

---
transition: slide-up
---

# Maturity isn‚Äôt always a good thing.

<v-click>

- There's a fine line between *mature* and *legacy*.
- Mature platforms are difficult for you to modify and others to build upon.
- No one understands how a mature platform works anymore, whether that‚Äôs lost institutional
knowledge or it just worked once so leave it alone.
- Hard to steer the ship quickly if you need to do something complex... like
multicloud (yikes).

</v-click>

<v-click>

## But it _can_ be a conscious effort to get you:

- Reliability without surprises.
- Velocity without chaos.
- Scalability without rip-and-replace (again).
- Governance without bureaucracy.

</v-click>

As teams mature, they're shifting _away_ from building API gateways for
themselves and _to_ enabling others while still maintaining control of policy
and governance.

# Why do _I_ care about this?

_A CNCF Story_

<!--

Years ago, I was in a room much like this one in Detroit, Michigan.

I was with 15 or so CTOs and tech leaders from the heaviest hitters of CNCF's
end user community. Can't name names, but they were big ones.

They were there to talk about CNCF's Cloud Native Maturity Model and how they
could apply it to their organizations, particularly from a platform engineering
perspective.

They loved having this kind of roadmap to look forward to, but still
struggled. 

CNCF is agnostic:

- They won't tell us what technology or projects to use!
- They won't tell us how to get better at a single technology or product! (except
maybe K8s itself)

Fast forward, and I'm in a place where I think about and write about and build
around API gateways all the time. Why not apply this methodology to a specific
technology?

# Methodology

- Implementers first, decision-makers second.
- Focus on what specific capabilities to learn and enable next via _generalized
estimates of progress_ <span style="display: block; position: absolute; font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; margin-top: -12px; right: 80px;">TY Martin Fowler!</span> rather than broad cross-functional or cultural change.
- Follow "threads" of capability growth between each level of maturity.
- Remain vendor agnostic and focused on capabilities of _off-the-shelf_ API gateway products
(cloud-specific, self-hosted, managed).
- Minimize the number of dimensions as much as possible!
- Each level gets:
  1. A general statement about where your API (gateway) program should be in
  relation to the rest of your DevOps &rarr; platform engineering efforts.
  2. Updates to each capability thread.
  3. A _failure state_ where most API gateway programs go south.

<!--

1. I wanted to align maturity with capabilities and implementation rather than
   trying to focus on platform engineering as a whole. An API gateway won't
   drive an entire infra organization.

2. This includes cloud-specific, self-hosted, and managed gateway products, but
   if you're creating your own API gateway, go read some engineering blogs from
   Uber or Tinder.

3. I want this to be (at least for now) simple.

# Level 1: Build

**You see the value of API gateways can bring to your platform and are ready to
build a solid foundation for managing API traffic and treating APIs as
products.**

<div style="font-size:0.8rem">

|    |    |
| -- | -- |
| Deployment & automation | Deployments and configuration changes all happen manually in a ticket-driven process |
| Routing & availability | Static routing to upstreams with manual failover via a mix of basic ingress and API gateway |
| AuthN+AuthZ+security | Relies on API keys and Basic Auth, some handled at the app/service layer instead of the gateway |
| Traffic management | Basic rate limits applied at the API gateway to prevent abuse and ensure fairness |
| Observability & debugging | Basic logs (response types/times/errors) collected at both pod and gateway, followed by manual debugging |
| Developer experience | Developers rely on DevOps/infra team to provision API deployments |
| Governance | Security policies manually enforced (perhaps inconsistently) during (perhaps infrequent) audits |

</div>

<!--

1. The most consistent thing is inconsistency here. Some apps still haven't
   offloaded functions like auth, and the idea of a consistent front door isn't
   solid yet.

2. Everything is kind of hard.

3. Kubernetes is mostly used as an infrastructure layer‚Äîthink routing.

-->

**Failure state**: "Our routing is a labyrinth and we're still hardcoding auth.
Can we go back in time to the load balancer days? Is it going to be like this
forever??"

![](./assets/this-is-fine.jpg){width=800 .center v-click}

<!--

1. Things start ad-hoc and they stay ad-hoc.

-->

---
transition: slide-up
---

# Level 2: Operate

**You're over ad-hoc changes and are ready to embrace a culture of automation,
which in turn gets both best pratices but your first taste of governance.**

<div style="font-size:0.8rem">

|    |    |
| -- | -- |
| Deployment & automation | Gateway configs are controlled via IaC and deployed with standardized tooling or GitOps |
| Routing & availability | DDoS protection, global load balancing, weighted traffic splitting for blue/green, canary deploys |
| AuthN+AuthZ+security | Support for JWTs or OAuth2, centrally managed and provisioned |
| Traffic management | Per-service and per-client rate limits; feature-flagging and A/B testing methods |
| Observability & debugging | Structured logs ingested into a single platform (stretch goal for distributed tracing!) |
| Developer experience | Self-service internal API registry for what does (or can) live behind the API gateway |
| Governance | Certain policies (AuthN/Z, logging, rate limiting) standardized across all APIs |

</div>

<!--

1. You replacing ad-hoc steps with automation.

2. You take your first steps to apply those essential policies like auth
   across all your APIs with a single front door that fans out to everything
   else.

3. You're starting to use more native K8s tooling to configure your gateways and
   make it all management. Does the word 'operator' ring a bell for anyone?

tickets, and a few days from everyone‚Äôs life.‚Äù 

![](./assets/tickets.png){width=600 .center v-click}

---
transition: slide-up

# Level 3: Scale

**You're ready to stop fighting fires and build for distributed, multi-region
(maybe multi-cloud?), and multi-team usage.**

<div style="font-size:0.8rem">

|    |    |
| -- | -- |
| Deployment & automation | Dynamic API gateway configurations via K8s operators |
| Routing & availability | Multi-region deployments with failover; round-robin/latency-based/sticky load balancing |
| AuthN+AuthZ+security | Fine-grained access control per API and mTLS wherever relevant |
| Traffic management | Per-region and per-tenant limits plus dynamic throttling based on load or error (circuit breakers) |
| Observability & debugging | Centralized API monitoring and anomaly detection to help developers with debugging |
| Developer experience | Teams can provision API gateways per project/function with central governance |
| Governance | API gateway compliance enforced via CI/CD and automated policy check jobs |

</div>

<!--

1. This is the multi-everything stage. You get distributed and you get a little
   bit dynamic.

2. Even if you're not ready to actually implement some of these big engineering
   efforts, you have a plan of action for both the people and technology
   required.

3. You're giving developers the ability to use your API gateway's K8s tooling,
   which is the first step in becoming a platform.

-->

**Failure state**: ‚ÄúThis is _our_ platform. It works. It's beautiful! Its highly
available and properly governed and fully automated‚Äî*WAIT DON'T TOUCH THAT*‚Äî‚Äù

---
transition: slide-up
---

# Level 4: Improve

**You're done with ticket-based development and bottlenecking your
peers&mdash;time to become an enabler for self-service (without things going all
wild west on you).**

<div style="font-size:0.8rem">

|    |    |
| -- | -- |
| Deployment & automation | Developers define APIs and gateways all the way to production all by their lonesome! |
| Routing & availability | Dynamic routing to support new or changing APIs; custom load balancing (PEWMA+weighting, proximity+load) |
| AuthN+AuthZ+security | Security teams define auth under policy-as-code for developers to self-service within compliance boundaries |
| Traffic management | Per-service blocks (geo, IPs), limits, and breakers are developer-defined and composed after global policies |
| Observability & debugging | Debugging gets easier with inspection and replay tools that work in dev/stage/prod |
| Developer experience | Developers manage API gateway settings within policy constraints |
| Governance | Developers can take new APIs into production without tearing down all the precious compliance work! |

</div>

<!--

1. This is where your role evolves completely from building for yourself to
   building for others. For better or worse?

2. You have to maintain the proper guardrails for security and compliance, but
   also let developer layer additonal rules, not undermine or override them, for
   their services. This is where composability makes a huge difference.

3. This is a big orchestration of IaC and Policy as Code that keeps people on
   the right rails and never gets in their way.

**Failure state**: "We built a developer platform... hope you like it?"

# Level 5: Adapt

**You're actively supporting emerging patterns while sticking to a long-term API
strategy... and not overcomplicating your architecture without a clear ROI.**

<div style="font-size:0.8rem">

|    |    |
| -- | -- |
| Deployment & automation | Gateways are policy-driven, dynamic, aware of changes to topology/workload, and autonomous |
| Routing & availability | Routing/LB gets fully dynamic based on request hedging, slow starts, server metrics (ORCA standard) |
| AuthN+AuthZ+security | API access isn't just on (nice token! nice cert!) or off, but based on user behavior and threat intelligence  |
| Traffic management | Limits of all types are auto-adjusted based on workload patterns and predictive analytics |
| Observability & debugging | AI root cause analysis identifies and mitigates service failures as logged by the gateway |
| Developer experience | Policy goes past guardrails to actively assist devs with recommendations of best practices and optimizations |
| Governance | Compliance monitoring adjusts gateway policies in real-time based on new threats or regulatory changes |

</div>

<!--

1. This is where things get real fuzzy but maybe also fun?. A lot of this isn't
   baked into API gateway products directly, so that means lots of integrations
   and data egress and so on.

2. I could've honestly put *AI AI AI* on every one of these, but it's not quite
   clear whether that's actually the future of this slice of technology.

3. Every part of this is based on Kubernetes tooling and telemetry‚Äînothing is
   static any more.
