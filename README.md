# API Gateway Maturity Matrix

## Methodology

- Implementers first, decision-makers second.
- Focus on what specific capabilities to learn and enable next via _generalized
estimates of progress_ rather than broad cross-functional or cultural change.
- Follow "threads" of capability growth between each level of maturity.
- Remain vendor agnostic and focused on capabilities of _off-the-shelf_ API gateway products
(cloud-specific, self-hosted, managed).
- Minimize the number of dimensions as much as possible!
- Each level gets:
  1. A general statement about where your API (gateway) program should be in
  relation to the rest of your DevOps &rarr; platform engineering efforts.
  2. Updates to each capability thread.
  3. A _failure state_ where most API gateway programs go south.
