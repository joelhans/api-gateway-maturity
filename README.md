# API Gateway Maturity Matrix

Every API needs a front door, but many organizations struggle to define what
"done" means for their API gateway implementation. Is authentication and rate
limiting enough? What about multi-region failover or self-service development
environments?

In this project, we're trying build on the CNCF's [Cloud Native Maturity
Model](https://maturitymodel.cncf.io/) to create a practical framework for API
gateway evolution across five key phases: **Build** (choosing fundamentals), **Operate**
(implementing CI/CD), **Scale** (mastering multi-region), **Improve** (balancing control
with velocity), and **Adapt** (enabling advanced patterns).

This project began as a talk for [KubeCon EU
2025](https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/event/1tx7N). The slides for the talk are
available in the [`kubecon-eu-2025-talk/`
folder](https://github.com/joelhans/api-gateway-maturity/tree/main/kubecon-eu-2025-talk) as a
[Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev) project.
